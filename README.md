ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Konstantin, Software developer living in the Russia.

I'm developping mainly in elephant PHP, but I love JS and other languages too.

I felt in love with the Symfony ecosystem as back-end and VUE as front-end. I also like to study similar technologies.

Feel free to reach me on telegram @shtikov
